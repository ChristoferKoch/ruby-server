# ruby-server
A simple server written in Ruby.

What needs to be done:

- [x] Serve files
- [ ] Handle Errors

  - [ ] Others (will update when developing error handling)
- [x] Multithreading
- [ ] Handle headers
  - [x] Parse headers
  - [ ] Check file language

This was inspired by the Python 3 Socket Programming Assignments found in *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* by James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross.
